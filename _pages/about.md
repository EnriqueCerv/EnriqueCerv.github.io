I am a PhD student carrying out a CQT scholarship in Assoc. Prof. [Marco Tomamichel's](https://marcotom.info/) group at the Centre for Quantum Technologies in Singapore.

My research interest is in quantum information, with a focus on quantum cryptography. I have previous experience in quantum machine learning, in particular variational quantum eigensolvers with tensor network inspired ansätze, group theoretic quantum algorithms and device dependent quantum key distribution. 

Previously, I was a quantum machine learning intern at Cambridge Quantum (now Quantinuum) and a research fellow in Prof. Dr. [Antonio Acín's](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/) group at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) in Barcelona.
I completed my Master's degree at the University of Copenhagen under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Laura Mancinska](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/604782).
